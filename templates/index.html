        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Ad spend waste is major problem facing all businesses. In 2021 alone, US$3 billion of ad spend was wasted. One of the major contributors to this waste is the mistake of targeting the wrong audience. An ad campaign's goal is to grab the attention of as many customers as possible. Therefore, it should be marketed towards the group that is most likely to buy the product. In turn, bringing more revenue.</p>
        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>In this project, we will explore the data collected by a supermarket about its cutomers. We will get some statistics about the general customers of the supermarket and their habits. Then we will attempt to divide the customers into segments using various clustering techniques. We will try to evaluate the clustering using some popular metrics. However, we will have to delve deep into the cluster in order to assess the correctness of the clustering algorithm. In the end of the project we would have a statistical description of the various customer segments and their spending habits. The supermarket can then utilize those segments in order to market their products better.</p>
        <h1>About The Dataset</h1>
        <p>The Customer Personality Analysis.dataset contains a description of the ideal customers of a company. It contains 29 columns detailing the habits and demographic of the customer. The features are divided into 5 categories.</p>
